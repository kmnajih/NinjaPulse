    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      HealthDashboard is a local-only dashboard for viewing your personal health data.
      It does not sell or share your data. Data is accessed directly from your connected
      fitness account after you authorize the app and is stored only on your local machine.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collected</h2>
    <p>
      HealthDashboard accesses health data you authorize via OAuth, such as recovery,
      sleep, workouts, and cycles. The app does not collect information unrelated to
      your health data.
    </p>

    <h2>How Data Is Used</h2>
    <p>
      Data is used only to display charts and metrics in the dashboard. No analytics,
      advertising, or tracking is performed.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Access and refresh tokens are stored locally on your machine. Health data is fetched
      from your connected fitness account and kept locally for rendering the dashboard.
      No data is transmitted to third parties other than your connected provider.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      HealthDashboard does not share your data with any third party. Data is only retrieved
      from your connected provider and shown to you in the local dashboard.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>
      You can disconnect the app at any time, which deletes the locally stored tokens. You
      can also revoke access from your fitness account settings.
    </p>
